Eğer zengin olmak isteseydiniz, bunu nasıl yapardınız? Sanırım yapabileceğiniz en iyi şey bir girişim başlatmak veya girişime katılmak olurdu.
Bu yüzlerce yıldır zengin olmak için güvenilir bir yöntem olmuştur. "girişim" kelimesi 1960'lara dayanır ama bir girişimde olanlar, orta çağların 
yatırım destekli ticaret seferlerinde olanlara oldukça benzemektedir.
</p> 
<p>
Girişimler genelde teknoloji içerir. Öyle ki "yüksek-teknoloji girişim" sözü neredeyse gereksizdir.
Bir girişim, zor teknoloji problemlerini göğüsleyen küçük bir şirkettir.
</p>
<p>
Birçok insan bundan fazlasını bilmeden zengin olur. Beyzbolda iyi bir atıcı olmak için fizik bilmek zorunda değilsiniz.
Ancak bence altta yatan prensipleri anlamak size bir üstünlük sağlayabilir. Girişimler neden küçük olmak zorundadır?
Bir girişim büyüdükçe sonunda girişim olmaktan çıkar mı? Ve neden genellikle yeni teknolojiler geliştirmek üstünde çalışırlar?
Neden bu kadar ilaç veya bilgisayar yazılımı satan var da mısır yağı veya temizlik deterjanı satan yok?
</p>
<h1>HENÜZ TAMAMLANMADI!</h1>
 <h3>The Proposition</h3>

<p>
Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to 
compress your whole working life into a few years.  Instead
of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as
hard as you possibly can for four.  This pays especially well
in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.
</p>

<p>
Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition.  If you're
a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can
get a job paying about $80,000 per year.  So on average 
such a hacker must be
able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the 
company just to break even.  You could probably
work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if
you focus you can probably get three times as much done in
an hour. 
<font color=#777777>[<a  href="#f1n"><font color=#777777>1</font></a>]</font>
You should get another multiple of two, at
least, by eliminating the drag 
of the pointy-haired middle
manager who would be your boss in a big company.
Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you
than your job description expects you to be?
Suppose another multiple of three.  Combine all these multipliers, and I'm
claiming you could be 36 times more 
productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate
job. 
<font color=#777777>[<a  href="#f2n"><font color=#777777>2</font></a>]</font>
  If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a 
big company, then a smart
hacker working very hard without any corporate
bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about
$3 million a year.
</p>

<p>
Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one
has a lot of wiggle room.  I wouldn't try to
defend the actual numbers.  But I stand by the 
structure of the calculation.  I'm not claiming
the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more
than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.
</p>

  If $3 million a year seems
high, remember that we're talking about the limit case:
the case where you not only have zero leisure time
but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.  Startups are not magic.  They don't change the laws of
wealth creation.  They just represent a point at the far end of the curve.
There is a conservation law at work here: if
you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a 
million dollars' worth of pain.  
For example, one way to
make a million dollars would be to work for the 
Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your 
salary.  Imagine the stress of working for the Post 
Office for fifty years.   In a startup you compress all
this stress into three or four years.  You do tend to get a 
certain 
bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain,
but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law.
If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.  <h3>Millions, not Billions</h3>  If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem
low to others.  Three <i>million?</i> 
How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?  So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right now.  It's not
a good idea to use famous rich people 
as examples, because the press only 
write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers.
Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man,
but you need more than
that to make as much money as he has.  You also need to be
very lucky.  There is a large random
factor in the success of any company.  So the guys you end 
up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very 
smart, totally dedicated, <i>and</i> win the lottery.
Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also 
happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular
blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for
DOS.  No doubt Bill did 
everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, 
and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if
there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side,
Microsoft's future would have been very different.
Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM.
They were effectively a component supplier.  If IBM had 
required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft
would still have signed the deal.  It would still have
meant a lot of money for them,  and IBM
could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.  Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market
to give Microsoft control of the PC standard.  From 
that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute.  They
never had to bet the company on a bold decision.  All they
had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more
innovative products reasonably promptly.  If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would
still have been a successful company, but it
could not have grown so big so fast. 
Bill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere
near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.  There are a lot of ways to get
rich, and this essay is about only one of them.  This
essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and
getting paid for it.  There are plenty of other ways to 
get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, 
theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly,
graft, lobbying,
counterfeiting, and prospecting.  Most of the greatest fortunes
have probably involved several of these.  The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich,
is not just that it's more legitimate 
(many of the other methods are now illegal) 
but that it's more
<i>straightforward.</i>  You just have to do something people want.  <h3>Money Is Not Wealth</h3>  If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is.  
Wealth is not the same thing as money. 
<font color=#777777>[<a  href="#f3n"><font color=#777777>3</font></a>]</font>
  Wealth is as old as
human history.  Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. 
Money is a comparatively recent invention.  Wealth is the fundamental thing.  Wealth is stuff we want: food, 
clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places,
and so on.  You can have wealth without
having money.  If you had a magic machine that
could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your
laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money.
Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is
nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.  Wealth is what you want, not money.  But if wealth is the important
thing, why does everyone talk about making money?   It is
a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice
they are usually interchangeable.  But they are not the same thing,
and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about
<i>making money</i> can make it harder to understand how to 
make money.  Money is a side effect of specialization.
